My name is Roumen Guha, and I'm currently a graduate student at the University of California San Diego. I study robotics, and I'm currently looking for an internship starting July 2019.

My résumé is linked in the tab above, if you're curious about my past experiences. But if you're still reading this, I'm betting it's because you want to know something about me that won't be on that piece of paper. Here we go.

I want to use robotics to perform tasks that humans can't or won't. Tasks such as [recycling](https://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2019-2020/tracking-your-trash-where-does-your-recycling-really-end-up), or collecting plastic [from the ocean](https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/). It should be possible to perform these tasks using only fuel sources available to a yacht on the open seas. Industrialization caused this pollution, maybe industrialization can undo it.

To that end, I intend to learn about distributed robotics, machine perception, and motion planning.
